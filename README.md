<h1>Variables, Constants, Calculations</h1>

Please start with the file named Vars_Consts_Calculations.java and follow the directions there. The file can be found next to this assignment’s PDF.

<h1>Restaurant Bill</h1>

Write a program that computes tax and tip on a restaurant bill. Ask user to input the bill amount and the tip percentage he/she wants to give to the waiter. The tax should be 10% of the meal cost, and must be set as a constant in your code. The tip should be calculated after adding tax. Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill on the screen.

Name your project RestaurantBill.java.

<h1>Interest Earned</h1>

Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a savings account after one year might be calculated as:




<h1>Amount = Principal * (1 + Rate/T)<sup>T</sup> <sup> </sup></h1>




<em>Principal</em> is the balance in the savings account, <em>Rate</em> is the interest rate (in decimal form – 0.0425 for 4.25%), and <em>T</em> is the number of times the interest is compounded during a year (<em>T</em> is 4 if the interest is compounded quarterly).

Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded. See a sample output below.




Interest rate:              4.25%




Times compounded:           12

Principal:                 $1000.00

Interest:                  $43.34

Amount in Savings:         $1043.34




Name your project InterestEarned.java.

<h2>Vending Machine</h2>

Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent increments (25, 30, 35,…, 90, 95, 100), and the machine accepts only a single dollar bill to pay for the item. For example, a possible sample dialog might be the following:

Enter price of item

(from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments):

<strong>45 </strong>




You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar,

So your change is 2 quarters

0 dimes, and 1 nickels.
